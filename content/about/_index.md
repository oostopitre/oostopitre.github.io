I am currently a Senior Data Scientist on the Applied Machine Learning team at [Uber](https://www.uber.com/) in San Francisco. I was born and raised in [Hyderabad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad), a bustling metropolitan city in Southern India.

Previously, I worked as a Research Scientist at [Citilabs](http://www.citilabs.com/); a software firm specialized in the design and development of products for Transportation Planning. I hold a Master’s degree in Transportation Engineering from University of Florida. I also received another Master’s degree in Infrastructure and a Bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Madras ([IIT](https://www.iitm.ac.in/)).

My passions include machine learning (Computer Vision using Deep Learning), coding (Python, R, PostgreSQL with PostGIS), electronic music and tennis.
